#​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Task Management API

## Project Description

This is a backend API project for Task Management Application built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, along with JWT-based user authentication.

users Can:- Manage personal and assigned tasks - Create, update, delete, and track task progress - Access only authorized data securely

The idea is to imitate the work of these productivity tools in the real world (Todoist or Trello) with a focus on:- Authentication & authorization - Relational data (tasks assigned to users) - Status workflows and business rules

---

## Learning Objectives

- Build a professional Node.js backend API - Implement JWT authentication and authorization - Design relational PostgreSQL schemas with foreign keys - Handle protected routes and user-specific data - Validate input and enforce business rules - Test APIs and handle concurrency/edge cases - Document APIs using Swagger

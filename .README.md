#​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Task Management API

## Project Description

This is a backend API project for Task Management Application built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, along with JWT-based user authentication.

users Can:- Manage personal and assigned tasks - Create, update, delete, and track task progress as long as they wish to.

## My Objectives

- Build a professional Node.js backend API using express - Implement JWT authentication and authorization. Design relational PostgreSQL schemas with foreign keys - Handle protected routes and user-specific data. Documenting with swagger and provide and testing well good structure endpoint.

## Tech Stack-
- i will start with the basic implementations install npm install express creating a server then adding nodemon to my package.json so we can run our code as i work throught this project.

- for my folder structure i will create and src at the root folder then inside i will create diffrent folder middleware for protectiong out route and for validating input you know we dont want a user to enter a wrong email or password from there we will focus on the second folder controllers where we will implement our logic for the task management taskController and user controller, routes for naming our endpoint of course schema for crud operaton using postgress for our table

- ## process
- from our objective all user should only be able get access to tasks create tasks update delete and patch mark as completed if he is authenticated. and to be authenticated they have to be register or login. for user to be able to login he must enter have an email, username and password. 

- i then created a postgres database for user table to store user data 
- i created .env file to strore all my credentials since i dont want it to be push or from people seeing it i used a dotenv package.
- from my config file i came up with a test connection logic to check if my postgres databe is connected succesfully
- inside schema i created a table for users to test the end point for user register and logic so user credentials is stored on postgress
- i created a route folder for user endpoint specifily both login and register when register your been prompt with a bearer token unique indentifier for each user
- then i came up with my middleware for protecting those endpoint first user cant login without the token so it check user id if it own a token if not 
- you get an error message talking about error handling i crap my logic userController in a try and catch block it will return a clear message of what went wrong
- for task creations i did go for the same apprach of creating a table for task
and added only login user get to see task created time,  date it was updated and mark as completed

- i did exprerince some real tought time in trying to implement the logic of user or authenticated user can update create a tasks the logic was i wanted user to be able to enter this title, description, due_date, assigned_to time
wraping it in a tryin and cash blog and and using status message codes

- user now can create his tasks update get tasks by id and get all task and patch tasks as complement

- ### endpoint project users
- to register [username, email, password]
- http://localhost:3000/api/user/register
- your provided with a unique id and a bearen token which will expire
- 
- to login [username, password]
- http://localhost:3000/api/user/login
- your get encrypted coed like this once your succeful aunthenticated: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6NiwiaWF0IjoxNzYyOTYzMDY5LCJleHAiOjE3NjI5NjY2Njl9.wBhOTAGqUS2_RLhJ2PCqVZwCcPFt_pZtYvtL3BKqB8E

## user create task, update, delete, getall task gettask by id and patch tasks
- create tasks with a post request 
- post to inseart new task 
- http://localhost:3000/api/tasks
